## **_Description_**

The project demonstates a smart automation infrastructure. It is built in hierarchy order of modules. The modules contain number of classes with methods.
There are main/common/helpers/actions/page_object modules.
In this way, the tests can be created in very simple way with a minimum lines of code.
Also the infrastructure allows to work with differend kinds of applications.
